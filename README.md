My project is titled "Cerebral-Stroke-Prediction" to predict whether a patient has a stroke or not, in order to provide timely interventions.

The input data is taken from Kaggle, and this dataset suffers from heavy imbalance, so we need to apply techniques to balance it. The most effective model here is SVM with the UnderSampling method, which gives the best results.

In the code, I have provided detailed descriptions in Vietnamese to support Vietnamese users.

After completion, I have deployed it on the Streamlit library for experimentation, and it has yielded good results: https://dp-machine-predict.streamlit.app/

This is the project I have completed and refined. If it is useful, I hope you will give your support to me.

Thank you!
